Original:
2,1,1  -> 50%/50% distribution
Nothing explicitly wrong, but the output claims one is larger than the other. Which would be wrong assuming the semantics suggest a strict inequality.

0,10,10 -> inf% prefer school in person and school from home.
Div by 0 error results in inf value. 

1,2,-2 -> 200% prefer school in person and -200% from home.
Negatives accepted, and arithmetic operations are still carried out as one would suspect, seeing as there are no further restrictions on the input other than integer values.

2147483648, N/A, N/A -> Apparently directly skips the other two inputs and result in a -40%/-40% distribution.
Value too large to store in integer type, as far as I gather its called integer overflow.

Logic error:
Line 20, I inverted the fraction, meaning if the inputs are reasonable pctLikeInPerson will be 100% or greater.
Line 30, I reversed the inequality, meaning the output conclusion will be wrong.

10,4,6 -> 250% prefer in person, 60% prefer school from home, more students prefer in person.
Only the 60% prefer school from home part is true. 

Compilation error:
Line 7 remove main method -> C2447 missing function header
Main method is required to run the executable, if I remember correctly you said it is because the main method is the very first method being run in the
accumulator, so if it isnt there the computer doesnt know where to start the programme. Although I do not know for sure if this is how it works - 
I know that you said the main method is required, so I figured it must fail to compile without. 

Line 10,11,12 remove variable declarations -> C2065 undeclared identifier
C++ cannot assign values to undeclared variables, thus throws the above error.

Line 15 remove semicolon -> C2146 syntax error: missing ";"
Since c++ is strongly typed we need to specify the end of the "line", or command/instruction, not sure what to call it. 
But every separate instruction should be separated by ";".

Line 21 remove double -> C2065 same as the first error, but this time just because I removed the type declaration, the variable is neither declared nor initialized.

Line 31 remove parenthesis -> syntax error + C2181 illegal else without matching if. 
Since the parameter is no longer registered for the if statement the syntax for if statement is wrong, and only the else part is registered.


When all errors exist at the same time only the first is encountered before the compilation fails.
