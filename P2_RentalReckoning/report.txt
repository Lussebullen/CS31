a. Obstacles:

Most notable obstacle I overcame was finding a reasonable way to simplify the code. 
Although I did not implement it because my current version is working. 
Other than that, I fell into the habit of using the mathematical a<b<c notation rather than 
a<b && b<c, I only caught this due to testing with g31.
Furthermore I have become more familiar with the IDE, and know how to switch main project
and the shortcut to running the code. 

One obstacle - or rather a confusion I encountered was regarding getline and cin. 
I mostly used cin, for all cases where I didnt anticipate any spaces in the input. 
However, when using cin the program would not continue if I only pressed enter, it required a non
backspace input, which is good to be aware of for future error handling. I decided to ignore it as
I didnt see any requirement to handle unintended newline characters in the spec.

b. Test cases:

Test cases for error handling - all give desired output.
Input		Description							
-10,1,1,J,y,1	Negative initial odometer reading				
0,1,0,J,y,1	Non positive rental days					
0,0,1,\n,n,1	Empty string customer name					
0,0,1,J,0,10	Non y/n input to luxury car					
0,0,1,J,n,0	month not in [1,12], month>12					
0,0,1,J,n,13	month not in [1,12], month<1					
5,3,1,J,t,1	End odometer lower than initial + wrong luxury car input	

This last error test also tests that only first error is reflected in output.  

Test cases for correct input
Input			Description
0,0,5,James Bond,y,1	Tests base charge for rental days luxury car (as well as getline working)
0,0,5,James,n,1		As above, but for non-luxury car
10,60,2,James,y,5	Test if the charge per mile works for first 100 miles
0,100,5,James,n,5	Test if charge per mile works at 101 miles non winter
0,101,5,James,n,5	Test if charge per mile transition works from 100 to 101
0,101,1,James,n,1	Test if charge per mile works at 101 miles winter
0,150,1,James,y,11	Test month transition nov
0,150,1,James,y,12	Test month transition dec
0,150,1,James,y,3	Test month transition mar
0,150,1,James,y,4	Test month transition apr
0,500,5,James,y,4	Test mile transition 500
0,501,5,James,y,4	Test mile transition 500

By no means exhaustive testing, but all transitions are tested in at least one branch.
